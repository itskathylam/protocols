# 75% glycerol 

This solution is for saving strains.

| Component             | Amount        |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| dH2O                  | 25 ml         |
| glycerol              | top to 100 ml |


- Add water first to a glass graduated cylinder, then top to the final volume with glycerol. I find this order much easier than the reverse.
- Use parafilm to seal the top of the graduated cylinder
- Mix well by inversion ~10-15 times
- Pour into glass bottle
- Autoclave
- For anaerobic use, add L-cysteine and resazurin and equilibrate in the anaerobic chamber

*Tip: For glycerol stocks, I like to add glycerol to 25% final. The high glycerol will make it easier to scrape for streaking later. However, it also thaws more easily, so I like to keep my cryovials on dry ice when I take them from -80C*
