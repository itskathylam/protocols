# Test lysogen supernatants for spontaneous induction of phage

### Equipment and supplies

- [ ] syringe and 0.2-micron syringe filter
- [ ] 2.0-ml microfuge tubes
- [ ] 8-strip PCR tubes
- [ ] Kimwipes

### Reagents and materials

- [ ] overnight culture of lysogen
- [ ] overnight culture of indicator strain
- [ ] appropripate plates for plaque assay, e.g., LB 10 mM MgSO4
- [ ] appropriate media for overlay, e.g., LB 0.7% agar

### Prep

- Melt media for overlay; aliquot 4 ml into glass tubes; keep at 60C water bath
- Warm plates at 37C until ready to use, esp. if using plates stored at 4C; this helps overlay from solidifying too quicky

### 1. Spot titer assay

1. Transfer 2 ml over lysogen culture into microfuge tube
2. Pellet cells
3. Transfer and filter supernantant
4. Make serial ten-fold dilutions of supernatant in 8-strip PCR tubes
5. Take aliquot of overlay from bath; seed with 100 ul of indicator culture
6. Vortex gently to mix; overlay on warmed agar plate
7. Allow to dry well: 5-10 min in flowhood or 30-60 min on bench top
8. Use a multichannel to spot 3 ul of supernant on overlay
9. Allow spots to absorb completely into overlay
10. Incubate overnight

### 2. Plaque assay

1. Transfer 2 ml over lysogen culture into microfuge tube
2. Pellet cells
3. Transfer and filter supernantant
4. Prepare the following samples in mcirofuge tubes:
    1. 100 ul indicator strain and 100 ul filtered supernatant
    2. 100 ul indicator strain only
    3. 100 ul filtered supernatant only
5. Incubate 10 min 37C for adsorption
6. Take aliquot of overlay from bath; seed with mixture
7. Vortex gently to mix; overlay on warmed agar plate
8. Allow to dry
9. Incubate overnight
