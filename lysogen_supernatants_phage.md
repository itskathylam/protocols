# Test lysogen supernatants for spontaneous induction of phage

### Equipment and supplies

- [ ] syringe and 0.2-micron syringe filter
- [ ] 2.0-ml microfuge tubes
- [ ] 8-strip PCR tubes
- [ ] Kimwipes

### Reagents and materials

- [ ] overnight culture of lysogen
- [ ] overnight culture of indicator strain
- [ ] appropripate plates for plaque assay, e.g., LB 10 mM MgSO4
- [ ] appropriate media for overlay, e.g., LB 0.7% agar

### Prep

- Melt media for overlay; aliquot 4 ml into glass tubes; keep at 60C water bath
- Warm plates at 37C until ready to use, esp. if using plates stored at 4C; this helps overlay from solidifying too quicky

### 1. Spot titer assay

- Transfer 2 ml over lysogen culture into microfuge tube
- Pellet cells
- Transfer and filter supernantant
- Make serial ten-fold dilutions of supernatant in 8-strip PCR tubes
- Take aliquot of overlay from bath; seed with 100 ul of indicator culture
- Vortex gently to mix; overlay on warmed agar plate
- Allow to dry well: 5-10 min in flowhood or 30-60 min on bench top
- Use a multichannel to spot 3 ul of supernant on overlay
- Allow spots to absorb completely into overlay
- Incubate overnight

### 2. Plaque assay

- Transfer 2 ml over lysogen culture into microfuge tube
- Pellet cells
- Transfer and filter supernantant
- Prepare the following samples in mcirofuge tubes:
    1. 100 ul indicator strain and 100 ul filtered supernatant
    2. 100 ul indicator strain only
    3. 100 ul filtered supernatant only
- Incubate 10 min 37C for adsorption
- Take aliquot of overlay from bath; seed with mixture
- Vortex gently to mix; overlay on warmed agar plate
- Allow to dry
- Incubate overnight
