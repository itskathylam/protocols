### Extract plasmid DNA 

*Note: All centrifugation steps can be carried out at room temperature.*

1. Transfer culture to centrifuge bottles. 
2. Pellet cells at 7000g for 10 minutes.
3. Discard supernant.
4. Resuspend in 20 ml TEG.
5. Lyse cells by adding 40 ml ALS. Invert ~10 times to mix.
6. Neutralize with 30 ml HSS. Invert 10 times to mix.
7. Cool at -70C for 20-30 min.
8. Pellet debris by centrifuging at 10,000g for 15 min.
9. Decant through cheesecloth into a new bottle, changing cheesecloths as required.\
*Note: avoid pouring too quickly as there might be clogging leading to overflow.*
10. Precipitate DNA by adding 90 ml isopropanol. 
11. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 10-15 min.
12. Discard supernant.
13. Invert bottle on a paper towel to dry pellet.
14. Resuspend DNA in 8 ml TE.
15. Transfer to smaller centrifuge tube.
16. Add 4 ml of 7.5 M ammonium acetate. Invert ~10 times to mix.
17. Incubate on ice for 20 min to precipitate proteins.
18. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 10-15 min.
19. Transfer supernatant to a new tube.
20. Precipitate DNA by adding 12 ml isopropanol. 
21. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 10-15 min.
22. Discard supernant.
23. Invert tubes on a paper towel to dry pellet.
24. Resuspend in 800 ul TE and transfer to microfuge tube.

### Treat with RNase

25. Split into two microfuge of 400 ul each.
26. To each tube, add 4 ul 5 M NaCl and 5 ul 10 mg/ml RNase A.
27. Incubate at 37C for 30 min.
28. To each tube, add 5 ul 10% SDS and 5 ul of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K.
29. Incubate at 37C for 30 min.
30. Extract with an equal volume of phenol chloform IAA.\
*Note 1: inspect the phenolic phase and do not use if it has turned from colourless to pink or if the pH is below 7.
*Note 2: this step can be omitted and the single chloform extraction will suffice in most cases.*
31. Extract with an equal volume of chloroform.
32. Precipitate DNA by adding 25 ul 5 M NaCl and 500 ul isopropanol.
33. Carefully remove DNA with a pipette, dip into 70% ethanol to wash, and place into a new tube, combining the precipitate from both tubes.
34. Allow DNA to thoroughly dry.\
*Note: the edges of the clump will begin to turn transluscent.*
35. Add 1 ml TE and allow the DNA to dissolve at 4C overnight.
36. To quantify by Nanodrop, dilute 1-in-10 and 1-in-100. Also confirm by gel electrophoresis.\
*Note: Typically, plasmid maxipreps yield concentrations of 500-1000 ng/ul for low-copy plasmids.*
