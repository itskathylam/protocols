# P1 transduction of E. coli 

This protocol has been adapted from online protocols available from the [Barrick Lab](http://barricklab.org/twiki/bin/view/Lab/ProtocolsP1Transduction) at UT Austin and [Sauer Lab](https://openwetware.org/wiki/Sauer:P1vir_phage_transduction) at MIT. 


### Reagents and materials

- [ ] P1 lysate of donor strain; refer to my protocol to [prepare a plate lysate](https://github.com/itskathylam/protocols/blob/master/plate_lysate.md) 
- [ ] overnight culture of recipient strain
- [ ] LB agar plates supplemented with 10 mM sodium citrate and antibiotics
- [ ] LB broth supplemented with 10 mM MgSO4 and 5 mM CaCl2
- [ ] 1 M sodium citrate 


### Transduce E. coli recipient strain

1. Pellet 1-2 ml of ovenight culture.
2. Resuspend in 1/3 volume of LB 10 mM MgSO4 5 mM CaCl2.
3. Use 100 ul of cell suspension per transduction.
4. Add 1-10 ul phage lysate prepared using the donor strain.\
*Note: the volume will depend on the titer but less is better to avoid co-infection; try a couple of volumes/dilutions and choose the most dilute one that produces transductants.*
5. Incubate 37C for 30 minutes.
6. Add 200 ul 1 M sodium citrate to minimize secondary infection.
7. Add 1 ml LB; incubate at 37C for 60 min to allow expression of selectable marker.
8. Plate 1/10 and 9/10 on LB agar plates supplemented with 10 mM sodium citrate and the appropriate antibiotics to select for transductants.
