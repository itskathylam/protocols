# Quick and dirty genomic DNA miniprep for PCR

Disclaimer: DNA prepared using this method is not clean and is not meant to be used in applications requiring clean DNA. This is a fast method to generate template to use for PCR, e.g., for Sanger sequencing confirmation. It generally works well for me, especially for E. coli, but YMMV. 

### Equipment and supplies

- [ ] microfuge tubes
- [ ] freezer, liquid nitrogen, or dry ice
- [ ] thermomixer set to 100C, or water bath set to 95C

### Reagents and materials

- [ ] overnight culture 
- [ ] T10E1 buffer, pH 8.0

### Protocol

- Transfer 1.5 to 2 ml culture into microfuge tube
- Pellet cells
- Discard supernatant and repeat 
- Remove all supernant
- Freeze the pellet using whichever option is most convenient:
    1. at -80C (good for end of the day)
    2. on dry ice (good for having lunch/coffee or attending a seminar)
    3. in liquid nitrogen (good if you want to finish asap)
- Thaw the pellet on ice
- Resuspend cells thoroughly in 100 ul of TE
- Use plastic cap locks (they are usually near the thermomixer) to secure lids. This prevents them from popping open.
- Boil for 10-15 minutes in the thermomixer at 100C
- Cool the tubes on ice before removing the cap locks. This reduces the pressure inside the tube.
- Pellet cell debris for 1 minute at max centrifuge speed 
- Transfer supernatant to a new tube
- Store at -20C
- Dilute 1 in 100 in TE to use as PCR template for Gram negative bacteria, e.g., E. coli; use directly or dilute 1 in 10 for Gram positive bacteria.
