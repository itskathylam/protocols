# Quick and dirty genomic DNA miniprep for PCR

Disclaimer: DNA prepared using this method is not clean and is not meant to be used in applications requiring clean DNA. This is a fast method to generate template to use for PCR, e.g., for Sanger sequencing confirmation. It generally works well for me, especially for E. coli, but YMMV. 

### Equipment and supplies

- [ ] microfuge tubes
- [ ] freezer, liquid nitrogen, or dry ice
- [ ] thermomixer set to 100C
- [ ] plastic cap locks (they are usually near the thermomixer)

### Reagents and materials

- [ ] overnight culture 
- [ ] T10E1 buffer, pH 8.0

### Protocol

1. Transfer 1.5 to 2 ml culture into microfuge tube
2. Pellet cells
3. Discard supernatant and repeat 
4. Remove all supernant
5. Freeze the pellet using whichever option is most convenient:
    1. at -80C (good for end of the day)
    2. on dry ice (good for having lunch/coffee or attending a seminar)
    3. in liquid nitrogen (good if you want to finish asap)
6. Thaw the pellet on ice
7. Resuspend cells thoroughly in 100 ul of TE
8. Use plastic cap locks to secure lids. This prevents them from popping open.
9. Boil for 10-15 minutes in the thermomixer at 100C
10. Cool the tubes on ice before removing the cap locks. This reduces the pressure inside the tube.
11. Pellet cell debris for 1 minute at max centrifuge speed 
12. Transfer supernatant to a new tube
12. Store at -20C
13. Dilute 1 in 100 in TE to use as PCR template for Gram negative bacteria, e.g., E. coli; use directly or dilute 1 in 10 for Gram positive bacteria.
