# Saving strains 

### Reagents and supplies

- [ ] solid media, equilibrated if necessary
- [ ] liquid media, equilibrated if necessary
- [ ] cryovials, screw-cap or crimp-top 
- [ ] 50% glycerol
- [ ] wooden sticks (or inoculating loops)

### From lyophilized (freeze-dried) cultures

1. Break open vial per instructions
2. Add 1 ml media and pipette well to reconstitute 
3. Transfer 50-100 ul onto agar plate; streak out for single colonies using multiple sticks
4. To the remaining volume, add glycerol to 25% final; freeze at -80C for backup
5. Incubate plate 
6. Visually check for contamination by confirming a uniform morphology
7. Inoculate single colony into 5 ml broth; include a negative control (i.e., inoculate with a sterile stick)
8. Grow to turbidity (1-2 days for most strains)
9. Make glycerol stock by transferring 1 ml into cryovial, adding glycerol to 25%, and freezing.
10. Optional: PCR and Sanger sequence the 16S rRNA gene

### From agar stabs

1. Use inoculating loop or wooden stick to stab into the growth; streak out for single colonies using multiple sticks
2. Incubate plate 
3. Visually check for contamination by confirming a uniform morphology
4. Inoculate single colony into 5 ml broth; include a negative control (i.e., inoculate with a sterile stick)
5. Grow to turbidity (1-2 days for most strains)
6. Make glycerol stock by transferring 1 ml into cryovial, adding glycerol to 25%, and freezing.
7. Optional: PCR and Sanger sequence the 16S rRNA gene
