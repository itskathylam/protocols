# DNA extraction from phage using Promega Wizard DNA Clean-Up Kit


The following protocol is largely taken from the [Center for Phage Technology protocol](https://cpt.tamu.edu/phage-links/phage-protocols/) for extracting DNA from phage lysates using the Promega [Wizard DNA Clean-Up System](https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protcards/wizard-dna-clean-up-system-quick-protocol.pdf).


### Equipment and supplies

- [ ] centrifuge tubes and centrifuge capable of 10,000g (e.g., Oak Ridge tubes with Sorvall JA-20)
- [ ] Wizard DNA Clean-Up Kit (Promega A7280)
- [ ] 3-ml syringe plungers
- [ ] 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes
- [ ] 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes, with no lids (can manually cut off)
- [ ] 2.0-ml microfuge tubes
- [ ] 37°C and 50°C water bath or incubator or thermomixer
- [ ] waste beaker


### Reagents

- [ ] phage lysate, 10^10 to 10^11 PFU/ml 
- [ ] 10 mg/ml DNase I, prepared from powder (VWR D3489) as per [CSH](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2006/1/pdb.rec8135.full?text_only=true)
- [ ] 10 mg/ml RNase A (Thermo Fisher EN0531) 
- [ ] 30% PEG-8000, 3 M NaCl non-sterile phage precipitation solution (stir overnight at RT to dissolve)
- [ ] 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)
- [ ] 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (Thermo Fisher AM2546)
- [ ] 80% isopropanol
- [ ] 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)


### Day 1

- Filter 10 ml lysate through 0.2 um into a 15-ml conical tube
- Add 10 ul 10 mg/ml DNase I
- Add 10 ul 10 mg/ml RNase A
- Mix by gentle inversion
- Incubate at 37°C for 30 min to digest contaminating nucleic acids
- Add 5 ml PEG/NaCl solution
- Mix by gentle inversion
- Incubate at 4°C overnight to precipitate phage


### Day 2

- Label the outer edge of centrifuge tube where the pellet is expected
- Transfer 15 ml mixture to centrifuge tube
- Centrifuge at 10,000g at 4°C for 20 min to pellet phage
- Carefully pour off supernatant
- Place tube down at angle to collect residual supernant away from the pellet
- Use a pipette to remove residual supernatant
- Resuspend pellet in 500 ul 5 mM MgSO4, washing the sides of the tube
- Transfer to 1.5-ml microfuge tube
- Pop spin to 21,000g to pellet insoluable matter
- Transfer supernatant to 2.0-ml microfuge tube
- Add 2.5 ul of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K
- Add 10 ul of 0.5 M EDTA
- Mix by gentle inversion
- Incubate at 50°C for 30 min to degrade and inactivate contaminating nucleases
- Cool tubes to RT
- Thoroughly swirl Wizard purification resin to resuspend; add 1 ml to tube
- Mix by gentle inversion
- Set up Wizard system by attaching syringe barrel to column and placing over 1.5-ml tube
- Prepare syringe plungers from 3-ml syringes (as plungers do not come with the kit)
- Pipette the phage-resin mixture into the syringe
- Over a waste beaker, place the plunger into the barrel, and push the mixture through the column (note: a slow flow rate indicates a good yield)
- Detach the entire syringe from the column before removing the plunger from the barrel
- Reattach the barrel to the column
- Wash the column by adding 2 ml 80% isopropanol to the barrel
- Over a waste beaker, place the plunger into the barrel, and push the wash through the column
- Detach the entire syringe from the column before removing the plunger from the barrel
- Reattach the barrel to the column
- Repeat the wash
- Detach the entire syringe and discard it
- Place the column into 1.5-ml tube with no lid
- Centrifuge at 21,000g at RT for 2 min to dry the column
- Transfer the column to a new 1.5-ml tube with no lid
- Pipette 100 ul TE buffer into the column
- Incubate RT for a few min
- Centrifuge at 21,000g at RT for 1 min to elute the DNA
- Gently pipette to mix the DNA and transfer to a new 1.5-ml tube


### Wrap-up

- Nanodrop the elution for DNA concentration
- Incubate the DNA at 65°C for 10 min to inactivate any remaining contaminating nucleases
- Store at -20°C


### Notes

- It is important use 1.5-ml tubes with no lids in the final spin and elution steps because sometimes the pressure of an object (an adjacent tube or centrifuge lid) can cause the tube to warp, and the mass of the minicolumn will cause the entire tube to collapse and break, leading to loss of sample. Yes, this did happen to me.
