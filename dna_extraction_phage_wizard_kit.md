# DNA extraction from phage using Promega Wizard DNA Clean-Up Kit


The following protocol is largely taken from the [Center for Phage Technology protocol](https://cpt.tamu.edu/phage-links/phage-protocols/) for extracting DNA from phage lysates using the Promega [Wizard DNA Clean-Up System](https://www.promega.com/-/media/files/resources/protcards/wizard-dna-clean-up-system-quick-protocol.pdf).


### Equipment and supplies

- [ ] centrifuge tubes and centrifuge capable of 10,000g (e.g., Oak Ridge tubes with Sorvall JA-20)
- [ ] Wizard DNA Clean-Up Kit (Promega A7280)
- [ ] 3-ml syringe plungers
- [ ] 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes
- [ ] 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes, with no lids (can manually cut off)
- [ ] 2.0-ml microfuge tubes
- [ ] 37°C and 50°C water bath or incubator or thermomixer
- [ ] waste beaker


### Reagents

- [ ] phage lysate, 10^10 to 10^11 PFU/ml 
- [ ] 10 mg/ml DNase I, prepared from powder (VWR D3489) as per [CSH](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2006/1/pdb.rec8135.full?text_only=true)
- [ ] 10 mg/ml RNase A (Thermo Fisher EN0531) 
- [ ] 30% PEG-8000, 3 M NaCl non-sterile phage precipitation solution (stir overnight at RT to dissolve)
- [ ] 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)
- [ ] 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (Thermo Fisher AM2546)
- [ ] 80% isopropanol
- [ ] 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)


### Day 1

1. Filter 10 ml lysate through 0.2 um into a 15-ml conical tube
2. Add 10 ul 10 mg/ml DNase I
3. Add 10 ul 10 mg/ml RNase A
4. Mix by gentle inversion
5. Incubate at 37°C for 30 min to digest contaminating nucleic acids
6. Add 5 ml PEG/NaCl solution
7. Mix by gentle inversion
8. Incubate at 4°C overnight to precipitate phage


### Day 2

9. Label the outer edge of centrifuge tube where the pellet is expected
10. Transfer 15 ml mixture to centrifuge tube
11. Centrifuge at 10,000g at 4°C for 20 min to pellet phage
12. Carefully pour off supernatant
13. Place tube down at angle to collect residual supernant away from the pellet
14. Use a pipette to remove residual supernatant
15. Resuspend pellet in 500 ul 5 mM MgSO4, washing the sides of the tube
16. Transfer to 1.5-ml microfuge tube
17. Pop spin to 21,000g to pellet insoluable materials
18. Transfer supernatant to 2.0-ml microfuge tube
19. Add 2.5 ul of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K
20. Add 10 ul of 0.5 M EDTA
21. Mix by gentle inversion
22. Incubate at 50°C for 30 min to degrade and inactivate contaminating nucleases
23. Cool tubes to RT
24. Thoroughly swirl Wizard purification resin to resuspend; add 1 ml to tube
25. Mix by gentle inversion
26. Set up Wizard system by attaching syringe barrel to column and placing over 1.5-ml tube
27. Prepare syringe plungers from 3-ml syringes (as plungers do not come with the kit)
28. Pipette the phage-resin mixture into the syringe
29. Over a waste beaker, place the plunger into the barrel, and push the mixture through the column (note: a slow flow rate indicates a good yield)
30. Detach the entire syringe from the column before removing the plunger from the barrel
31. Reattach the barrel to the column
32. Wash the column by adding 2 ml 80% isopropanol to the barrel
33. Over a waste beaker, place the plunger into the barrel, and push the wash through the column
34. Detach the entire syringe from the column before removing the plunger from the barrel
35. Reattach the barrel to the column
36. Repeat the wash
37. Detach the entire syringe and discard it
38. Place the column into 1.5-ml tube with no lid
39. Centrifuge at 21,000g at RT for 2 min to dry the column
40. Transfer the column to a new 1.5-ml tube with no lid
41. Pipette 100 ul TE buffer into the column
42. Incubate RT for a few min
43. Centrifuge at 21,000g at RT for 1 min to elute the DNA
44. Gently pipette to mix the DNA and transfer to a new 1.5-ml tube


### Wrap-up

45. Nanodrop or Qubit the elution for DNA concentration
46. Incubate the DNA at 65°C for 10 min to inactivate any remaining contaminating nucleases
47. Run on a gel with dilution series of lambda phage DNA
48. Store at -20°C


### Notes

- It is important use 1.5-ml tubes with no lids in the final spin and elution steps because sometimes the pressure of an object (an adjacent tube or centrifuge lid) can cause the tube to warp, and the mass of the minicolumn will cause the entire tube to collapse and break, leading to loss of sample. Yes, this did happen to me.
