# Preparation of plate lysate

This protocol has been adapted from phage protocols available from the [Center for Phage Technology](https://cpt.tamu.edu/phage-links/phage-protocols/) at Texas A&M University.  


### Reagents and materials

- [ ] overnight culture of host
- [ ] phage lysate
- [ ] microfuge tube
- [ ] agar plates supplemented with 10 mM MgSO4
- [ ] agar overlay (standard 0.7% agar; try as low as 0.2% agarose for pinprick plaques)
- [ ] disposable spreader
- [ ] 1 ml pipette tips, manually cut off a few mm of the tip with scissors for larger opening
- [ ] 15 ml conical tubes
- [ ] syringe
- [ ] 0.45 micron syringe filter
- [ ] 10% bleach spray bottle


### Day 1: Set up plates

1. Melt agar overlay; dispense 3-5 ml into culture tube; hold at 55C water bath.
2. Warm agar plates at 37C, especially if stored at 4C.\
*Tip: warm plates will help prevent the overlay from solidifying too quickly.*
3. To a microfuge tube, add 100 ul of overnight culture.\
*Note: this amount may need to be increased to form an appropriate lawn.*
4. Add 1-100 ul of phage, depending on the titer.\
*Note: prepare a few serial ten-fold dilutions if you are unsure of the titer.*
5. Incubate for 10 min at 37C to aid adsorption.
6. Remove tube of agar overlay from water bath.
7. Add host-phage mixture.
8. Vortex gently to mix, avoiding formation of bubbles.
9. Pour over agar plate, spreading evenly.
10. Allow to solidify and incubate overnight.


### Day 2: Harvest phage

1. Clean up work space to prevent phage contamination.
2. Add 5 ml SM buffer to plate; allow to sit for 10 minutes to allow softening.
3. Using a spreader, break and suspend the overlay.
4. Using the manually cut 1-ml pipette tips, transfer the suspension to a conical tube.\
*Tip: work slowly and gently to avoid splashing to prevent phage cross contamination!*
5. Centrifuge the suspension to pellet agar and bacterial debris. 
6. Filter the supernatant through 0.45 micron filter into a clean conical.\
*Note: the filter may clog; if so, gently remove from the syringe and use a new filter.*
7. Label the lysate, including the date and host strain, and store at 4C.
8. Spray 10% bleach and wipe work area thoroughly. Remove biohazardous waste from bench.
