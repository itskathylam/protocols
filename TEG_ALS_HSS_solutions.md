These recipes are from: Trevor Charles, 1990. Construction of a genetic linkage map of the Rhizobium meliloti 1600 kilobase megaplasmid pRmeSU47b, generation of defined megaplasmid deletions, and study of megaplasmid-borne genes. PhD Thesis, McMaster University.

### TEG: resuspension

Dilute from concentrated stock using dH2O:

| Component              | Final concentration | Notes                  |
|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)      | 50 mM               | 1 in 20 of 1 M stock   |
| EDTA-Na (pH 8.0)       | 20 mM               | 1 in 10 of 0.2 M stock |
| Glucose                | 1% (w/v)            |                        |
