# Shipping packages via Fedex to international collaborators


The following protocol is for shipping packages from the G.W. Hooper Research Foundation at UCSF.
Review the instructions for packaging UN 3373 dangerous goods from Fedex.

### Prepare the documentation

- Fill in the Fedex waybill for international shipping. Make sure it has the Special Handling field for dangerous goods (incl. dry ice). Check yes and include a customs letter/shipper's declaration.
- Write the customs letter; see my [example](files/shipping_customs_letter.pdf). The important part is to state that materials being shipped are for research purposes only and have no commercial value and that they are not considered harmful. Declare all items contained. State the value as $1.
- Make sure to include HS codes and values in both the waybill and letter.
- Make sure the customs letter is in a clearly labeled envelope.

### Package your sample

- Find an aluminum-lined bag for dry ice. These often come with Agilent reagents.
- Place the bag inside a styrofoam container. Weigh the box.
- Place dry ice at bottom of bag; shake during filling to maximize space. Weigh the box again to get the weight of dry ice. Use liberal amounts of dry ice in case of delays in shipping. For reference, I used 4 kg to ship a handful of tubes to Switzerland.
- Place samples on top, with a thin layer of dry ice over them. Close and tape the aluminum-lined bag.
- If there is head space between the bag and the top of the styrofoam container, fill it with crumpled paper towels or newsprint for insulation.
- To be nice to your collaborators, include a sheet of paper that is an itemized list of contents in the box (also email this file to them). Put this sheet in a bag to prevent it from getting wet, and place it on top of the paper towels.
- Close the styrofoam container securely. 
- Place the styrofoam container in the cardboard box for shipping. If there is excess space, fill it with crumpled newsprint for insulation. 


### Label the box

- Attach the waybill on top.
- Print and attach a UN 3373 label for dangerous goods / biological substance category B.
- Attach a dry ice label on the side. Fill in the blank for the weight of dry ice.
- Attach the customs letter to the side of the box.
