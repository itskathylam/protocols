| Component       | Amount     | Final concentration | Notes        |
|-----------------|------------|---------------------|--------------|
| PEG-8000        | 200 g      | 20%                 |              |
| NaCl            | 146 g      | 2.5 M               | 58.44 g/mol  |
| dH2O            | to 1 liter |                     |              |

- Start with ~750 ml dH2O
- Add PEG-8000 and NaCl
- Heat at 55-65C several hours to aid dissolving
- Use a magnetic stir bar to stir slowly until cooled to room temperature
- Top to 1 L with dH2O

To precipitate M13 phage from E. coli supernatant, add 1/5 volume.
